Learn basics of Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google and later donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes has become one of the most popular tools for managing containerized workloads in production environments.

Key features and concepts of Kubernetes include:

1. **Containers:**
Kubernetes leverages container technology (e.g., Docker) to package applications and their dependencies into isolated units, making them portable and consistent across different environments.

2. **Pods:**
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes is a Pod. A Pod is a logical group of one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace and volumes. Containers within a Pod can communicate with each other via `localhost`, simplifying inter-container communication.

3. **Replication and Scaling:**
Kubernetes enables horizontal scaling of applications by managing multiple replicas (instances) of a Pod. It ensures the desired number of replicas are running, and it can scale up or down based on resource utilization or custom metrics.

4. **Services and Networking:**
Kubernetes provides Services, which are stable network endpoints used to expose applications running in Pods. Services allow seamless communication between different parts of an application and can be used to expose applications to external traffic.

5. **Volumes:**
Kubernetes offers various storage options through Volumes. Volumes provide data persistence for containers and allow data to outlive the lifecycle of the Pods.

6. **Namespace:**
Kubernetes uses Namespaces to create virtual clusters within a physical cluster. Namespaces help in organizing resources, implementing access controls, and providing isolation.

7. **ConfigMaps and Secrets:**
ConfigMaps and Secrets allow you to manage configuration data and sensitive information (like passwords or API keys) separately from application code, making it easier to change configuration without redeploying the application.

8. **Deployments and StatefulSets:**
Deployments and StatefulSets are higher-level abstractions in Kubernetes that provide declarative and self-healing mechanisms for managing Pods. Deployments are suitable for stateless applications, while StatefulSets are used for stateful applications that require stable network identities.

9. **Auto-Scaling:**
Kubernetes supports Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) based on CPU utilization or custom metrics. HPA automatically adjusts the number of Pod replicas to meet the defined resource utilization targets.

10. **Self-Healing and High Availability:**
Kubernetes ensures high availability by continuously monitoring the health of Pods and restarting or rescheduling them in case of failures. It maintains the desired state of the application, making it a self-healing system.

Kubernetes abstracts the complexity of managing containerized applications, enabling developers and operators to focus on application development and infrastructure management. It is cloud-agnostic and can run on various infrastructure providers, from on-premises data centers to public cloud providers.

Kubernetes has revolutionized the way modern applications are developed and deployed, making it easier to build scalable, resilient, and portable applications that can run in diverse environments.
